    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This homemade sushi is so simple and fun to make! It is definitely sushi for those who may be nervous to try sushi! This also makes a great appetizer and my whole family loves them! Most of these ingredients can be found in your local supermarket and the result is yum-yum-yum! Serve with a bowl of soy sauce and a lump of wasabi.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup medium-grain white rice, uncooked</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>4 ounces smoked salmon, cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>4 scallions, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>PBring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool, about 10 minutes. Toss with vinegar.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>Place 1 sheet of nori on a rolling mat, layer with 1/4 of the rice, and press rice out to the edges. Lay 1/4 of the salmon, 1/4 of the cream cheese, and 1/4 of the scallions in the center. Roll up carefully and wrap in plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, salmon, cream cheese, and scallions. Place in the refrigerator until chilled, at least 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>Remove sushi rolls from the refrigerator, discard plastic wrap, and cut each roll into 6 slices. Layer all rolls on a platter.</p></li>
    </ol>
